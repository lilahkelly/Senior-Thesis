This paper, officially titled Automated Greenhouse Watering and Heating System for the Schenectady ARC, details the research, implementation, and debugging of a multifaceted project that promotes better accessibility for the Schenectady ARC greenhouse. Particularly, this project aimed to automate the greenhouse watering and heating system while conserving energy, valuing safety, and staying below budget. The finished project consists of waterproof circuits with temperature and moisture sensors that have their readings communicated via a star network communication system with RF modules using Python. The user can interact with the system (activating the watering or heating system) based on these readings using a GUI developed with accessibility in mind.
